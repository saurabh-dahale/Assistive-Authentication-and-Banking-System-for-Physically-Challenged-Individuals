# Assistive-Authentication-and-Banking-System-for-Physically-Challenged-Individuals

This is a minimalistic banking authentication system and user interface which can be
easily navigated by individuals with some form of physical disability. People who are not able to
use the traditional input devices like mouse and keyboard have no proper way to utilize and
experience the convenience of the revolution called internet banking.

This system will allow them to do so by implementing a real time biometric authentication
algorithm, an inventive passcode protection technique and an effective face tracking algorithm.
This will enable the user to take advantage of two-factor authentication without using their mouse
and keyboard. The first being face identification and the second being passcode protection which
can be entered via video. They also will be able to navigate through and perform simple net
banking tasks with ease. This will be achieved by simulating mouse motion and button click events
with the help of the face tracking algorithm. The only input device required for this system to run
would be a webcam which is now present in every smartphone and computer.
